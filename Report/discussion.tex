In implementing this algorithm, we found that the algorithm was very sensitive to its tuning parameters, such as the learning rate $\epsilon$ and the mass matrix $M$. In a more complete implementation of Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, we would want to include adaptive tuning parameters, like those that are used in STAN. Our results from the simulated and real data validated our code and model. While we used logistic regression, the package we have written is modular enough to let the user enter his or her own model.
