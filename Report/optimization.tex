Any MCMC algorithm is inherently sequential, and so can't be parallelized (though multiple chains can be run at the same time). Each parameter's full conditional distribution depends on other parameters, so loops are a natural implementation. Unfortunately, loops are quite slow in Python. In this section, we discuss an alternative, optimized version of our code that is written in C++ and is callable from Python via the Pybind11 package.\\

One drawback to a C++ implementation is the limited availability of easy-to-use random sampling functions. To complete our algorithm, we wrote a random multivariate normal function based on a Cholesky decomposition (necessary for the momentum updates and noise terms) and a random sampling function (necessary for the stochastic gradient descent). Unfortunately, the random sampling function is quite slow, significantly dampening the impact from the low-level speedup.
